    boards holding you up seem to be begging to be put out of their misery, squeaking
    and cracking with each step you take. When you finally finish climbing you notice
    that there is a faint light coming from one of the rooms. Attempting to open
    it shows that the door is locked. Surely there is a key around here\u2026.\r\n\r\n1
