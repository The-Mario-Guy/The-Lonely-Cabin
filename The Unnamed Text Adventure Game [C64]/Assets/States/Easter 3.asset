    M: Get ready to catch her.

    

    L: She''s
    not coming down!

    

    M: She''s up there! It''s hard to see through those
    clouds. I hope we can get rid of ''em. Get the hint?

    

    M: Hey, you!
    Get off of my cloud! It''s been one of those days. Come on, Luigi. We ain''t
    afraid of no Koopas.

    

    L: Woah!

    

    M: Hurry!

    

    M:
    Spooky! Where''s the Princess?

    

    L: Over there! Look! Wendy''s Hotel.

    

    M:
    Be careful! When you pinch Wendy''s pennies, they pinch back.

    

    M:
    That wasn''t so hard. Was it?

    

    P: Boys!

    

    B: (laughs)

    

    L:
    That''s that creepy Bowser''s laugh.

    

    M: Look! This is it, Luigi.
    Remember, where there''s smoke...

    

    L: There''s fire!'
